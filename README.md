# Shopping Cart Web App in flutter

This is my first endeavor to create a web app in flutter with dart.
In screenshot folder, i have added some image of what i have created.
In this repo, I had created a design template only, no business logic or network calling implemented. Simply create a navbar menu and on tap on it redirect and create a design which response as per the device resolution.

# Build andÂ deploy:

For a build web app, use this command: webdev build
This command is used to building a web means it generates a build folder and this folder will be used for the deployment. If you want to test that this will work or not simply follow the below step(Only for windows).
Search Turn windows feature on or off in windows
Then checked IIS (Internet Information Service)
Search IIS and open it.
In Connection Section, You can see sites
Right-click on sites and add website
Add Site name, set physical path of your build folder to generate above
Assign any IP address and click OK.
In the Actions section, you can found browse the website.

You have successfully done the web deployment.
If you want to deploy on web hosting simply you need to upload the build folder on the hosting server.
